			<dt>Making HTML into TeX
			<dd>We did this with the "WWW Book" to print it. See the Makefile for example, and the scripts html2latex.sed and sub1.sed. We wrote a special introduction, but otherwise all the text was hypertext from the W3 project.

			<dt><a href="https://www.duckduckgo.com/">Generating HTML</a>
			<dd>These are scripts for generating SGML hypertext from things like directory listings, etc. Also, for checking and correcting dubious HTML.

			<dt>Server log analysis
			<dd>Analysing server logs requires first of all changing the numeric internet node numebrs into domain names. httpd-analyse.c is a program to do that. Feed the results through awk and grep of your choice!
