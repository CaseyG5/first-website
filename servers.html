		<h1>W3 Server Software</h1>
		<p>A W3 server, like the ftp daemon , is a program which responds to an incoming tcp connection and provides a service to the caller.There are many varieties of W3 server software to serve different forms of data.
		</p>		
		<h2>The basic daemon</h2>
		<p>The basic W3 daemon program serves files already in hypertext or plain text. This daemon then is used as a basis for many other types of server and gateway. Documentation includes:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.duckduckgo.com/">User guide</a> .</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.duckduckgo.com/">Internals</a> -- a description of the code.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Much of the above may also apply in whole or part to other servers mentioned below. Whatever server you are running, you will probably be interested in:

		</ul>
		
		<h2>Making a new server</h2>
		<p>This daemon is often used as a basis for a more specific server for a given application. A server which allows a world of data to be seen as part of the W3 universe is known as a gateway. (Most servers could therefore be regarded as gateways, but the term implies some conversion or mapping between dissimilar worlds) . For short tutorials with examples, see:

			<li><a href="https://www.duckduckgo.com/">Writing a server in C</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.duckduckgo.com/">Writing a server as a script</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>It is a good idea to pick the basic daemon or one of the servers below as a starting point when making a new server.
		</p>
		<h2>Other servers and Gateways</h2>
		<p>These are servers which provide data extracted from other systems. they are built using code from the basic daemon, or scripts.

		<dt><a href="https://www.duckduckgo.com/">FIND gateway</a>
		<dd>for CERN/VM XFIND which calls a REXX exec to get the information from the XFIND system running on the CERNVM mainframe.

		<dt><a href="https://www.duckduckgo.com/">VMS Help gateway</a>
		<dd>This allows any VMS help files to be made available to WWW clients. Runs on VAX/VMS.
		
		<dt><a href="https://www.duckduckgo.com/">WAISGate</a>
		<dd>A gateway to information available using the W.A.I.S. protocol.
		
		<dt><a href="https://www.duckduckgo.com/">DCLServer</a>
		<dd>A server for VMS systems which allows you to write a gateway to your own favorite information system using DCL.

		<dt><a href="https://www.duckduckgo.com/">System33</a>
		<dd>A (big) csh script server providing data including Xerox System33 documents, man pages in plain text, phone numbers, etc. etc...!

		
		<dt><a href="https://www.duckduckgo.com/">Oracle</a>
		<dd>A generic server to oracle. Could be used as a basis for gateways to specific Oracle databases.
