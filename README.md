# The First Website
A replica of info.cern.ch

## General Info
We recreated the first [website](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html)

 only descends one level, including pages for the following categories and a few others.
 
- What's out there
- Software
- Technical
- Getting code
- Help
- People
- How you can help
- History
- Bibliography
