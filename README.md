# The First Website
A replica of info.cern.ch

## General Info
We recreated the first [website](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html)

 only descends one level, including pages for the following categories:

- W3 news
- FAQ
- What's out there
- Subjects  
- W3 servers
- Help
- Software
- Line Mode  
- NeXTStep
- Servers
- Tools
- Mail robot
- Technical
- Bibliography
- People
- History
- How can I help
- Getting code
- FTP
 
## Languages
Project was created with:
* HTML

## Process
We replicated the main page and the pages accessible through the 25 links.  
We created the link by using the following attribute:  
`<a href="url">Link Text</a>`

We also used:
<h1></h1>     Heading 1
<h2></h2>     Heading 2
<body></body> Body
<p></p>       Paragraph
<dt></dt>     Definition Term
<dd></dd>     Definition Data
<xmp></xmp>   Extensible Metadata Platform

## Sources
This project is inspired by Tim Berners-Lee, a British physicist, who created the first 
website, while working at CERN, a particle physics lab in Switzerland.
